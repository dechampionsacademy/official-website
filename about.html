      ABOUT OUR SCHOOL
    </h1>
    <div class="about-message">
      <p>
        DE CHAMPIONS ACADEMY is a Primary/Secondary education institution that was founded on the <span class="date">18th of November, 2017.</span>
        It was co-founded by MR Daniel Ossai and MRS Oluchi Anyaoha
      </p>
      <p>
        Our school has had a vision of nurturing young children into future leaders. Training them academically, mentally and socially. Making the children generally fit to identify as a responsible member of the society. This vision has not been so easy to pull-off for both teachers and management. But by the grace of God the vision is still very much alive and on the right track. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After gaining a seven years experience, we've been able to improve on ourselves in every aspect of the school. Achieving different milestones in the short period of time. With the massive increase in population the school is now able to look back to when it was just a few pupil/student in each classroom and feel proud of the movement because it also shows potential for a greater tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our inspiration is gotten from our name 'Champion' which means winner, top, highest, best. We always try to be the best in what we do putting in our all everytime. DE CHAMPIONS ACADEMY is a citadel of learning, filled with qualified teachers practicing their skills in a conducive learning space in order to maximize the knowledge of the pupils/students. We try our best to make learningg fun by building a teacher-student/pupil bond making the students comfortable when learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to say a big thank you to all our exisiting parents that have been with us in trying times. We know your worth and it would not be taken for granted. We love and pray for everyone of you that your heart desires will be granted by God. And we also pledge our dedication to the job as we are trying to bring out the best version of your children.
      </p>
      <p>
        We urge all our prospect parents, students and pupils to join the vision in creating a world of difference for your children. Making them winners, The best, On top and most importantly, making them CHAMPIONS!.
